Software Engineer or Senior Software Engineer - ( 23143683 )

OLIS is engaged in a few major projects. The first initiative replaces all the solutions that support the automation of Montana’s legislative process. The second converges many different technical solutions into the same technical stack. The third reduces the sprawl of solutions by integrating functionality. The fourth improves OLIS’s technical posture by implementing APIs for every piece of code we touch. The fifth reduces technical debt by using test driven development, in addition to having guidelines for unit and behavioral testing code coverage. The sixth establishes, or refines, standards and guidelines for internal and vendor code as OLIS matures it capabilities.
This position is expected to engage with an established agile team(s) that is supported by dedicated DevOps and infrastructure engineers. In the near term, the position is responsible for solving issues and enhancing functionality with custom code. In a longer term, the position will assess quality of vendor code, deciding whether to accept the code or work with vendors to improve their quality. In either term, the position will integrate the code with OLIS’s ecosphere of APIs. The vision is to deliver all data and processing layer logic via API with Swagger style documentation so that DevOps can package our APIs into containers. We do have established pipelines and are far down the path of CI/CSD.
The challenges OLIS face are:
current solutions are often tightly coupled with operating system and specific configurations of application servers or utilities;
we need to rapidly mature our automated unit and behavioral testing capabilities;
the sprawl of technologies and data provides a significant stream of maintenance and operations tasks;
past technical architecture decisions mean that refactoring activities are broad and deep; and,
there is a lack of documentation and knowledge of vendor-built systems.
The team’s opportunities and benefits are:
we are considered as a strategic partner by our business partners, rather than a “keep the lights on” engine;
our agile process allows the team to identify and alleviate team challenges, with excellent support from management;
management supports product owner(s) and the team to set priority and schedule;
we have the luxury of driving our timeline, instead of being dictated dates;
it’s a great professional / private split;
Montana is a great place to live with four distinct seasons and a gigantic number of outdoor activities and attractions;
the position is extremely secure; and,
State benefits are pretty good – pension, health/vision/dental insurance, etc.
ASSIGNED DUTIES AND TASKS:
Analyzes computer systems, user requirements, resolves problems, and provides implementation and maintenance support to users. Determines the nature and cause of production system failures and takes the necessary steps to resolve issues and problems. Maintains and supports legacy applications and systems as needed.

Develops knowledge and understanding of customer’s business by studying documentation and interviewing personnel. Assists project team members with design tasks, which may include data structure design, system flow, and program specifications. Assists with analysis of requested modifications for existing systems, as well as analysis of incorporating new functions and procedures.
Designs, develops, and conducts training classes on software applications used by staff, including developing and writing class syllabus and user guide documentation.
Performs or recommends revision, repair, or expansion of existing computer programs to increase operating efficiency or adapt to new requirements. Carefully evaluates the interdependencies between the program to be modified and any other existing programs, database interfaces, re-usable code modules, department business practices, and user interactions.
Provides scoping and manages scope changes appropriately (including level of effort, time estimates and resource needs and impacts) on projects within an application group or division.
Leads complex and/or mission critical projects; determines assignments, work methods and standards for programmers and programmer analysts assigned to the project, including creating the work breakdown structures or detailed project plan within an agile framework; validates all work and provides guidance where necessary.

About Us:
We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
About The Role:
In 2022, Notion acquired the next-generation calendar app, Cron. We’re looking for a Software Engineer to join our small but nimble team to build innovative, AI-powered products that create the magic of “1 + 1 = 3” and showcase the best of using Cron and Notion together.
What You'll Achieve:
We're looking for an experienced individual contributor who enjoys working alongside other experienced engineers and designers to iterate and build across the entire tech stack. We are open to candidates who can work across the entire stack, as well as those who may want to focus on a few specific domain areas, depending on their interests and experience.
Build the core, user-facing product. You'll build the product and everything behind the scenes from the ground up, having a huge and direct impact by shipping your work to users on prod daily.
Prototype new AI capabilities. You’ll work with Notion AI engineers to incorporate large language models (LLMs) into our products.
Use modern web tech and influence the stack. We use React on the frontend, Node/Express on the backend, and Typescript across the full stack to build a best-in-class client and infrastructure that scales. As we build out our stack, you get to make critical choices and lay the foundations.
Self-direct your work and co-own the product. You'll have autonomy and responsibility because we are all individual contributors. You'll be involved in shaping the roadmap and owning the execution of it.
Create a robust and scalable backend. Build PostgreSQL database models, performant REST API with Redis cache, delta sync, and offline support using IndexedDB, 3rd party integrations, product analytics, transactional email, and service monitoring. We currently deploy to Heroku to keep DevOps simple, but we have plans to move to a cloud provider and we’ll look to you to help establish viable long-term cloud infrastructure and operations.
Build UI components. You'll implement basic UI based on Figma mocks and our design system. You'll collaborate with designers and frontend engineers on user-facing features powered by your backend code. We rapidly ship UI that has a native feel to it by polishing CSS, interaction states, and animations.
Solve interesting technical problems. Bring your full creativity to solve super-challenging technical problems: from complex backend architecture with 3rd party integrations, real-time collaboration, syncing app state, to nifty client-side interactions.
What We're Looking For:
You have 5+ years of engineering experience
Demonstrated ability to execute with excellence: You have thrived in fast-paced environments, tackling complex technical challenges with exceptional skill and precision.
Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
Curious and quick learning. We don't expect you to have experience in every technology we use, but to learn and be productive quickly. Owning several repos and jumping into all of them doesn't scare you.
Design sensibility. While you'll co-craft the interface with top designers and frontend engineers, we expect you to have a knack for great UX, such that you feel if something is off and can flag it, or better yet, polish it.
Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.
Bonus Points:
You’re interested in productivity apps. You might use your calendar to time block, try out Chrome extensions, configure custom app launchers, or optimize your time in other ways.
You've built or maintained apps using React, React Native, Electron or other frameworks.
You have experience or interest in DevOps and the infrastructure side of building great software products.
You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation made due to a disability, please let your recruiter know. Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in New York, the estimated base salary range for this role is $130,000 - $250,000 per year.

Software Engineer, UI - World of Warcraft

Good user interface is elegant and intuitive; excellent user interface is a portal into adventure. It enables a player to be wholly engrossed in gameplay and immersed in story. The World of Warcraft user interface team is looking for a UI Engineer with the talent to craft good UI but with the creativity and passion to make exceptional UI.
So, what do we look for in our UI engineers? You are able to identify and tackle challenges within an existing yet constantly evolving code base (the world of Azeroth is no small thing). We’re also highly collaborative, so you are comfortable working closely with others to develop a shared vision and then work to see it through to completion. Being World of Warcraft, it’s also helpful if you’re familiar with our gameplay (or other MMO’s) or perhaps have dabbled in making your own UI mods.
We view user interface as an art form, and we feel Blizzard is a special place to hone your craft. Here you’ll be in a creative environment designed to encourage your best work, to foster learning and growth, and to empower you to translate your dreams into reality. We’re on a quest to iterate and craft our UI into the best it has ever been; until the complex becomes instinctive, and player tools evolve into a natural extension of the gaming experience. So, join us - if you understand our excitement and real passion for what we do and where we're taking our UI, we want to hear from you!

What you will do…
Work collaboratively with designers, engineers, and artists to build compelling UI features
Implement functional and elegant UI features from approved concept images and paper designs
Provide continued engineering support for existing UI features
Develop back-end functionality to support front-end features
Participate in and contribute to a culture of inclusion and diversity

To succeed, you must have…
Proficiency in C++ or similar language
Knowledge of modern data structures and algorithms
Self-motivation and willingness to participate in many areas of game development
Excellent teamwork and communications skills

We’re also interested in hearing about…
Experience with developing UI addons for World of Warcraft
Knowledge of high-level scripting languages such as Lua, Perl, or PHP
Knowledge of World of Warcraft or other MMORPGs
Passion for playing and making games (especially Blizzard games!)
We love hearing from anyone who is enthusiastic about changing the games industry. Not sure you meet all the qualifications? Let us decide! Research shows that women and members of other under-represented groups tend to not apply to jobs when they think they may not meet every qualification, when, in fact, they often do! We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment and strongly encourage you to apply.

We are committed to working with and providing reasonable assistance to individuals with physical and mental disabilities. If you are a disabled individual requiring an accommodation to apply for an open position, please email your request to accommodationrequests@activisionblizzard.com.

The Role:
Come join an inclusive, innovative, and collaborative frontend engineering team that values diverse perspectives when building solutions that delight our customers. We are a team of five (four engineers, one manager) that work on a business critical web application that is a core component in the receipt generation path. As a frontend engineer, you will regularly build, design, and test customer facing features for our web applications in collaboration with a UX designer, a product manager, backend engineers, and your customers while seeking feedback from your team. You will work on microfrontends and media playback, typically writing TypeScript within React and Angular based applications, but are excited to learn new technologies when needed. You will independently own the project lifecycle starting with the technical design all the way through rollout and launch, seeking feedback from senior engineers as necessary. You leverage your background in frontend engineering to make thoughtful architectural decisions and raise tradeoffs to your team when the path forward is unclear or likely to be contentious. You mentor more junior engineers to help build a stronger more independent team.

If you are not sure that every qualification on the list describes you exactly, we'd still love to hear from you! At Amazon, we value people with unique backgrounds, experiences, and skillsets. If you’re passionate about this role and want to make an impact on a global scale, please apply!

We are excited to work with you! Come build the future with us!

Key job responsibilities
Collaborate with teammates to identify and solve technical problems.
Work with your customers, UX designers, and product managers to help design what we build for customers
Design, develop, test, and deploy reliable and secure distributed systems using React, TypeScript and AWS technologies with clean, maintainable code.
Mentor and grow more junior team members.
Participate in code reviews by providing feedback on your team members’ code.
Be curious and deep-dive into web applications to root cause defects and optimize for performance, maintainability, scalability, and extensibility.
Propose tools, frameworks, automation, and processes that are used by the whole team for development.

A day in the life
You wake up and either get on the Amazon shuttle or use your free Amazon provided bus pass to commute to the office in the morning, though if you have an early meeting (8 am) you sometimes choose to take it from home, and then commute into the office later.
Once you arrive, you decide to get a drink from Fulcrum Café which is right next to your building. Your office has free Starbucks drip coffee and tea, but sometimes you just need an espresso or a cold brewed iced tea.
Now that you are well caffeinated, you are ready to start your day. You get into the office and say hello to your coworkers before sitting down at your desk.
You check your slack messages and emails to make sure there isn’t anything urgent. Product has a question regarding implementation details on your current project so you decide to resolve the discussion in person since you think that will be faster. You get up from your seat and look over the dividers in the aisle to begin the discussion and are able to resolve it in five mins. (If this was not an in office day, you would have just as easily spun up a quick Chime call or Slack huddle.)
You then have an uninterrupted two hour block for coding till your next meeting. You finish this block feeling super productive.
You then join a meeting with Product and UX to discuss the low fidelity mocks that the UX team has provided for an upcoming project that you will be the technical lead for. You’re glad they brought the mocks to you early in the development cycle because you had a few concerns about the user experience. Because of the tight coordination and collaboration, the UX Designer will be able to adjust the UX before building the higher fidelity mocks in Figma. The group leaves the meeting excited about the direction the product is going and how it will improve the customer experience.
After that, you join the team’s daily “sync up” to discuss progress from the prior day, what you are working on today, and any help needed. Your team ends sync up with everyone smiling and saying “Go Team!”
You then sit down to have lunch in the office cafeteria with some of your team members and your partner team members. Every other Tuesday though you instead join the official team lunch and joke around with your team members.
After lunch, you need some help with the build system and post in the team slack room. The team quickly jumps in, and you get unblocked within 10 minutes. You’re happy that your team is responsive and collaborative.
You spend a few more hours coding and then realize its already 3 pm. You remember that your child has an appointment at 4:30 pm, so you head home to pick them up from day care, letting the team know you will make up the hours later in the night or early tomorrow morning since you didn’t want to use vacation/personal time.


About the team
Team Culture: We are a team of four frontend engineers and are expanding to six. The team environment is inclusive, supportive, and collaborative. We build our culture through quarterly team events, biweekly team lunches, understanding each others’ strengths and growth areas (so that we know how to leverage each other when needed), and working as a team, not individuals, to meet our goals. We promote a culture that is open to being wrong and respectfully challenging each other (manager included). We believe in hiring diverse skillsets and perspectives and believe these skillsets multiply the team’s effectiveness and growth by allowing each team member to learn from each other team member’s unique strengths.

Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity: We care about Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity and strive to create a working environment that allows you to bring your authentic self to the workplace. We are flexible with working hours to allow you to meet commitments outside of work. The JWO organization has an active Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity team that focuses on development, retention, and education through targeted programs such as Sponsorship, Allyship, and a Leadership Reading Club. Additionally, the inclusion team provides quarterly community service events!

Team Charter: We are a feature team that is aspiring to split out a platform team as JWO continues to grow. As such, the team invests in driving down JWO costs and designing reusable frontend components to transition the team from a monolith to a microfrontend architecture. This architecture and the reusable components are used by other teams to allow the organization to move faster and scale at reduced cost. Additionally, we enable the business by supporting new selection in the stores (like the ability to sell beverages).

Tech Stack: Our tech stack is a mix of and Angular and React TypeScript web applications. We only support the Chrome browser. We are currently moving off Angular by rebuilding our existing UIs in React based on new designs from the UX team. What differentiates our technology from many other frontend teams is that we own a custom video player and do graphical rendering of three dimensional volumes using Three.js. If you are looking to expand your frontend knowledge, this team is an excellent team to grow with!

We are open to hiring candidates to work out of one of the following locations:

Seattle, WA, USA
